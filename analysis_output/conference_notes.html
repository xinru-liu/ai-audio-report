<strong>Summary:</strong> There are hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos kept on ice around the world, and no one can decide what to do with them. All our stories go through at least three layers of editing, and we'll also have fact checkers on top of that. We also do some rip-roaring yarns that just whizz you along.</p>
<h3>Segment 6</h3>

<strong>Summary:</strong> MIT is a cool place to work with, and an amazing place if you're nosy like I am. We make sure things are buttoned up right, and I think that's really important, particularly now. We have great explainer series, MIT Technology Review, Explains, and a What's Next series.</p>
<h3>Segment 7</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> So which technologies are going to have the most profound impact on the economy and on people's lives in the future? So, for that list, they picked 10...
<strong>Summary:</strong> CNN's annual list of the 10 technologies that will have the most profound impact on the economy and on people's lives in the future. The criteria we use is basically, is this a technology that's going to have a major effect on the world? That effect doesn't have to be good, by the way.</p>
<h3>Segment 8</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> We also ask, is there a reason to feature it this year in particular? Why not last year? Why not next year? Is there something we can point to a facto...
<strong>Summary:</strong> We take everyone's ideas, we chuck them all in as massive Google Doc, organized by category. Then we have a lot of discussions and debates about which technology should make it. So, we then vote for their favourites.</p>
<h3>Segment 9</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> So, not just things which are coming out of the lab, but also consumer stuff, different fields, some really deep tech as well The whole process takes ...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Annual list includes tech coming out of the lab, consumer stuff and some really deep tech. It's helped us spot a lot of major developments before they were widely known elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Segment 10</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> In 2009, we put intelligent software assistance on the list, really prompted by Siri, which at that time was being developed by a company of the same ...
<strong>Summary:</strong> In 2009, we put intelligent software assistance on the list, really prompted by Siri, which at that time was being developed by a company of the same name and then was later required by Apple. And then, five years ago,we put satellite mega-constellations on the lists. And now, the number of satellites has, the orbiting earth has nearly tripled. But I'll be first to tell you, we don't always get it right.</p>
<h3>Segment 11</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> This was a new kind of air traffic control, which would do away with ground-based radar systems and control towers and allow planes to transmit and re...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Social TV never really took off in the way that we envisaged it. But I would suggest that maybe the rise of things like Twitter and second screening while you're watching a live sporting event or a season finale or something is sort of along the same lines.</p>
<h3>Segment 12</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> In 2015, we went all in on Magic Leap, which you may remember was a company that was developing an augmented reality headset And the promo videos were...
<strong>Summary:</strong> In 2015, we went all in on Magic Leap, which you may remember was a company that was developing an augmented reality headset. Last year in 2016, a company called Solar City was building one of the largest plants for solar panels in the world in New York.</p>
<h3>Segment 13</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> So now you're probably thinking, come on, let's just get on with it Let's get to the list This is why I'm here I just like to tease you as long as pos...
<strong>Summary:</strong> The Vera Rubin Observatory is a massive new telescope in Chile. It's due to take its first images in the middle of this year if everything goes according to plan.</p>

<strong>Summary:</strong> Astronomers will use that information to make the most detailed 3D map ever of the Milky Way. Astronomers will also create a time lapse video of the night sky.</p>
<h3>Segment 16</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> We'll pick this one because obviously all of us search the internet every single day and this represents the biggest change in decades in how we navig...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional search companies like Google and Microsoft are incorporating large language models into their search engines. That means you can type in a query and in Google's case, what's called an AI overview pops up.</p>
<h3>Segment 17</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> The idea is conversational in style and really for me it makes a lot more sense than, I mean, when you look at it, it makes almost sense that you hold...
<strong>Summary:</strong> The idea is conversational in style and really for me it makes a lot more sense. It's not just in search engines but also in things like chat GBT and apps. And it could be a step towards useful AI agents as well, which will go out onto the internet and complete tasks.</p>
<h3>Segment 18</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> Oh no, putting glue on your pizza That's because we think that AI, Google AI overview had sucked up lots of Reddit joke entries about what you should ...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Google AI overview had sucked up lots of Reddit joke entries about what you should put on pizzas. So, next, small language models. The idea is that they don't have as much training data Or as many parameters.</p>
<h3>Segment 19</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> So, these small language models might be more suited to the specific purpose or task you're trying to get them to do So, example, if you're a law firm...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Small language models might be more suited to the specific purpose or task you're trying to get them to do. For example, if you're a law firm that writes lots of contracts, you don't need a large language model that's been trained on the entirety of every Disney script ever. You probably just needs a large model that really knows about contracts.</p>
<h3>Segment 20</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> The more efficient, the less expensive, produce for your missions, which is becoming increasingly important They can also work offline and soon be sma...
<strong>Summary:</strong> The more efficient, the less expensive, produce for your missions. They can also work offline and soon be small enough to run on your phone. Some of them are doing just as well as big ones on benchmark tests that we train large language models on.</p>
<h3>Segment 21</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> Its large language model GPT-2 wasn't bad Of course, it was easier to impress people way back in 2019 But GPT-3, just a year later, was the true break...
<strong>Summary:</strong> GPT-3 was the breakthrough that cemented OpenAI's dominance and laid the foundations of today's boom. The correlation between size and performance became known as the scaling law. More parameters means more fine green pattern matching, helping the model capture more information.</p>
<h3>Segment 22</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> But there's a twist The law has limits The marginal gains between top end models seem to be trading off When OpenAI released its latest model in the G...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Smaller and smaller models that can do more with less. Large language models have become a tool for almost any job. We don't need Thor's hammer for every little nail. Regular handlers will do just fine.</p>
<h3>Segment 23</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> Most big tech firms now boast fund-sized versions of their flagship models for this purpose The growing number of smaller companies offer smaller mode...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Smaller models are more efficient making them quicker to train and run. Smaller models work with a fraction of computing power acquired by the giant cousins. And so they burn less energy and travel while they can run rice market.</p>
<h3>Segment 24</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> Even car companies are building small models and they're vehicles as customers come to expect that chap what experience wherever they are and whatever...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Small is the next big thing. Even car companies are building small models and they're vehicles as customers come to expect that chap what experience wherever they are and whatever they're doing. Cattle birthing remedies. Flouting cows.</p>
<h3>Segment 25</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> Methane is eight times as bad as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere So we're looking at techniques that we can find to prevent the cows...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Cow burps are one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Methane is eight times as bad as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Segment 26</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> One called bovia is available in 55 countries already and it inhibits an enzyme in the cows gut That makes methane from hydrogen and carbon dioxide du...
<strong>Summary:</strong> One called bovia is available in 55 countries already and it inhibits an enzyme in the cows gut. Reduces emissions by about 30% in dairy cows. Several other startups are working on different technologies which use a type of red seaweed that they hope will be even more effective.</p>
<h3>Segment 27</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> But now that cattle burping supplements have begun moving into the market, for me the big question is, are cattle ranchers and dairy farmers really go...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Cattle burping supplements have begun moving into the market. The big question is whether cattle ranchers and dairy farmers will widely adopt them. The promise among some of the companies is that they'll deliver a secondary benefit.</p>
<h3>Segment 28</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> Which would enable companies to differentiate their products in some ways and be able to charge some of the premium for them Finally, there are some w...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Last year Denmark announced plans to enact a tax on cattle emissions. Farmers are not super surprisingly on a huge fan of that kind of approach. The real test will be whether or not these pills prove to pay off for the farmers.</p>
<h3>Segment 29</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> But still pretty niche, but we think they're coming Really coming For years these companies such as Waymo have been out gathering data and testing the...
<strong>Summary:</strong>  Robo Taxis are now available in dozens of cities around the world, fully autonomously with no safety driver. But still pretty niche, but we think they're coming Really coming.</p>
<h3>Segment 30</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> As you remember back in the days of autonomous vehicle research, like 10, 15 years ago, companies had to map every single bit of every single road wit...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Car companies are using Geronative AI to make synthetic training data for scenarios that don't happen that often. Others are developing general purpose Robo Taxi AI models that can be trained in one city and then transferred over to a new city.</p>

<p><strong>Original:</strong> In fact, it's a much bigger business in China than it is here in the United States By Duse Apollo Go, for example, just one of several Robo Taxi opera...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Robo Taxi is a much bigger business in China than it is here in the United States. Duse Apollo Go, for example, just one of several Robo Taxi operators there, and now it's in a completed more than 9 million passenger rides.</p>
<h3>Segment 33</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> In addition to biofuels, which have been around for a while, there are new ways of creating alternative jet fuels that are now starting to scale up in...
<strong>Summary:</strong> There are new ways of creating alternative jet fuels that are now starting to scale up in production. These fuels will be blended with petroleum to reduce emissions in flights, but eventually we cut off planes that run on 100% sustainable aviation fuels.</p>
<h3>Segment 34</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> Another company called LanzaJet opened its first commercial scale production facility in Georgia about a year ago to turn ethanol from corn or sugar i...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Sustainable aviation fuel has to make up at least 2% of all fuels used in airports in the EU and the UK. This is going to ramp up gradually until it reaches 70% in 2050.</p>
<h3>Segment 35</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> So the vast majority of jet fuel is going to have to switch over from fossil fuels to these lower-mission alternatives by them And this is one of thos...
<strong>Summary:</strong> This is one of those ones that when it was brought to the pitching discussion in our newsroom, I was quite surprised by. I thought it was much more far behind where it actually is. I was really stunned by what the compelling case that I've kind of reported made for this one.</p>
<h3>Segment 36</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> I've seen a lot of robot demos in my life as a tech journalist and they always show a robot doing something really specific really really well like fl...
<strong>Summary:</strong> We're yet to see a robot that can just be adapted easily to different environments to different tasks. We're getting closer now because of stuff that's coming out of the generative AI and large language model revolution. Instead of teaching robots to do by carefully programming and scripting them, it's letting them learn how to do things on their own.</p>
<h3>Segment 37</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> For that to teach them about the environment, you need, it's not as easy as just like the written text and that you would need for a large language mo...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Robots are combining all these different types of data into new data sets designed just for robots. And then using that special data set to train robot specific AI models that are specific to them and their needs.</p>
<h3>Segment 38</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> So with these techniques, the idea is it gets easier to train a robot on just a few examples of one task and then have it pick up that task right away...
<strong>Summary:</strong> With these techniques, the idea is it gets easier to train a robot on just a few examples of one task and then have it pick up that task right away. It also navigates terrain without having studied that particular terrain.</p>
<h3>Segment 39</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> So more than one million people around the world still become infected with HIV every year You know probably that there are preventative drugs out the...
<strong>Summary:</strong> More than one million people around the world still become infected with HIV every year. The new drug is called lenecapavir and you get it as an injection once every six months. It's made by a company called Giliad.</p>
<h3>Segment 40</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> It targets a structure within the virus that holds the viruses from netting material and either prevents the virus from replicating and entering a hum...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Last year Giliad announced results from a trial of more than 5,000 women and girls in Uganda and South Africa. It showed the drug was 100% effective in preventing HIV infection.</p>
<h3>Segment 41</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> In that Uganda and South Africa trial, none of the women and girls who got the lenecapavir injections got HIV, the drug was 100% effective You don't e...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Giliad has already signed licensing agreements with six manufacturers who will make generic versions of the drug and sell it in 120 low resource countries that have a high incidence of HIV.</p>
<h3>Segment 42</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> And the manufacturers aren't allowed to sell the generic drugs in middle income countries, which probably won't be able to afford those US level price...
<strong>Summary:</strong> The drug is very exciting, but it's not the end of the story We still need to make sure that when it's approved, this drug is accessible to everyone who needs it Brilliant. Next up, we have green steel.</p>
<h3>Segment 43</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> Impact is what we're interested in, and green steel has the potential to have the gigantic impact on emissions Here's why The world produces a lot of ...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Stegra is building a new plant that will produce steel without creating any emissions. It's the first of its kind in the world, and the company hopes to start producing steel there next year.</p>
<h3>Segment 44</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> Stegra instead uses hydrogen gas to pull oxygen out of iron ore to make iron, and then it makes that hydrogen through electrolysis using electricity p...
<strong>Summary:</strong> Stegra uses hydrogen gas to pull oxygen out of iron ore to make iron, and then it makes that hydrogen through electrolysis using electricity produced from wind and hydro power to split water. There's a compost startup called Boston Metal, which spun out from MIT.</p>
<h3>Segment 45</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> So we've known about them for quite a while, but scientists also found ways to make them in the lab without needing embryos, which obviously had ethic...
<strong>Summary:</strong> New treatments for type 1 diabetes and epilepsy based on stem cells are showing real promise. Could help millions of people get off insulin for good or dramatically reduce the number of fits that people have.</p>
<h3>Segment 46</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> So for an example, one of our reporters spoke with a patient who was in a trial by a company called Neurona Therapeutics He was having epileptic seizu...
<strong>Summary:</strong> There have been a few trials by different companies showing that studies can take stem cells from someone, transform them into stem cells and then turn them into the kind of cell that produces insulin in the pancreas. When researchers put those newly transformed cells back into patients, some of those patients start producing insulin on their own for the very first time.</p>
<h3>Segment 47</h3>
<p><strong>Original:</strong> Obviously, the treatments could have huge positive benefits for all the patients, but it also marked for us a really important moment in stem cell res...
<strong>Summary:</strong> The MIT Technology Review has compiled a list of 10 breakthrough technologies for 2025. These are our best educated projections about the future based on what we know right now.</p>

 Hello, hello, hello, south by. Thank you very much for having me. Someone much cooler than me last night said that you meant to say south by, not south by south west. So I'm trying it out. Let me know if you think I can get away with it. I'm hoping to give you a little bit of an insight into what that's like. So our newsroom covers emerging technologies. That's things like AI, obviously, climate, energy solutions, biotech, robotics, computing space. Today I'm here to share with you one of our biggest editorial products of the year, which is our 10 breakthrough technologies. We do it every single year and it's the technologies that we think are going to have the biggest impact on our lives in the years to come. The idea again is like give you a little bit of a glimpse at what's coming around the corner so you can be better prepared. So let's get started. Firstly, I'd like to start with telling you a bit about who we are. So MIT technology review, and you might be able to guess this from the name, is owned by MIT and is based on MIT's campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We started almost 125 years ago, which makes us one of the world's continuously published oldest magazines. We're editorially independent, so MIT does not have any say in what we cover. While our main base is in Cambridge, we also have hubs in London and surprise, surprise. That's where I'm from. San Francisco and New York, we also have editors and reporters scattered around a lot of the US as well. So we're in the business of helping explain the future. That's what we do. Turning facts into understanding. We tell you what's going to happen now, so you can plan for what's going to happen next. So to do this, our journalists go out every day, dig up scoops, spot trends, speak to researchers, go through scientific reports, and find out the stuff that you really need to know about. We skip the incremental things, and we don't care about hype. Instead, we try to focus on technologies that are going to have a really high impact. So that would impact is something we're going to come back to quite a few times while I'm chatting. We're always asking ourselves what really matters in the long run. So for example, reporters will pitch me in the editors stories, saying, you know, I'd like to write a story about this thing. And the question we ask is, okay, why do I care? Why does it matter? Why is it important? They're the questions that kind of cover all of our reporting. It's also not just about what's cool, although we do cover a lot of cool stuff. We also think a lot about what it will take for a new technology to become commercially viable, what will make it become a reality. We also think about the positive and negative effects that technology might have. So we publish every day, technologyreview.com, so recommend you all go and check it out. We also have a bunch of free newsletters. We have that cover things like AI, climate, biotech. We also have a daily newsletter called the download, and I'll share you a link to that later on. And we also have a really cool print issue, whereas the picture, oh yeah, we're going to look at that cover. Amazing. So this is our newest issue, and they come out every two months and they're themed, and this one came out last week. It's all about relationships. So it's packed with some really cool features, relationships between employees and employers, and to do surveillance and automation. A really great package on the people who are having relationships now with chatbots and what that means for their lives and how they're using it in different ways. Also, relationships with our past, looking at ancient DNA, what it tells us about not just our ancestors, but also our future humans as well. And then finally, there's a really thought-provoking piece in this issue all about frozen embryos. There are hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos kept on ice around the world, and no one can decide what to do with them. So the vast majority of our stuff is online, as apart from the magazine. So we also do big stories telling you about the future. Look at that one up on the right, what is AI? That's one of our big swings that we do, which is really trying to encompass. Put your arms around everything that is AI, and explain why it's actually such a difficult concept to nail down, and why no one actually really agrees what it is. We also do some rip-roaring yarns that just whizz you along with fantastic storytelling, like that story about the guy who's helping troops on the front line in Ukraine. We've got a huge amount of attention in getting things right, and I'm giving you this preamble because I want you to set up that you can trust us before we get into the list itself. All our stories go through at least three layers of editing, and we'll also have fact checkers on top of that. We make sure things are buttoned up right, and I think that's really important, particularly now. We have great explainer series, MIT Technology Review, Explains, and a What's Next series, which gives you a little look around the corner on future topics. We also have our narrated podcast where you can listen to our stories. Anyway, giving you all of this preamble to say, yeah, it's a pretty cool place to work with, and it's also an amazing place if you're just really, really, and say should be nosy like I am. And I bet loads of you are too. Anyway, I'm going to share you some details on how to read more of our stuff towards the end. So let's get on to the main event. So 10 breakthrough technologies. So this started in 2001. The editors, then, as before I joined, decided to make a list of what they call educated predictions about the future. So which technologies are going to have the most profound impact on the economy and on people's lives in the future? So, for that list, they picked 10 technologies. So, 24 years later, we're still doing it in pretty much the same way. Our annual list is our way of giving our audience some informed speculation about the future, where we think these developments are happening now will lead in the future. So, a bit of background on the process of how we do this. We ask every reporter and editor in the newsroom to bring ideas for which technologies they think are going to make, should make this next year's list based on their reporting and their insights. The criteria we use is basically, is this a technology that's going to have a major effect on the world? That effect doesn't have to be good, by the way. We also look at technologies that are going to have a big impact in a negative way as well. We also ask, is there a reason to feature it this year in particular? Why not last year? Why not next year? Is there something we can point to a factor that's going to really accelerate its development? Or a reason that's now going to become much more widely adopted, for example? So, we take everyone's ideas, we chuck them all in as massive Google Doc, organized by category, and then we have a lot of discussions and debates about which technology should make it and why. I guess that's a kind of a euphemism before we have some arguments about how this is going to work. But it's fun. That's what's fun about being in a newsroom. So, we then vote for their favourites. Everyone votes for their favourites. We whittle down the list. That knocks off a few of the things which should get any votes, apart from the person who submitted it. And then we try to pick a real mix of things. So, not just things which are coming out of the lab, but also consumer stuff, different fields, some really deep tech as well. The whole process takes quite a few months. And, I'm going to say, our track record is pretty good over the years. The annual exercise we'd go through has helped us spot a lot of major developments before they were widely known elsewhere. Here are a few examples. So, our very first list in 2001 had data mining on it. So, a practice which I'm sure you all know for now, for better or worse, has underpinned online advertising and personalisation across the web for decades. In 2004, we saw advances in natural language processing. We saw where it was going. And we put universal translation on the list. Today, obviously, translation apps are widely available. Google, Apple, ChatGPT, and elsewhere, all use this technology. And we all use it. I'm sure you guys do as well a lot. And it's almost taken it for granted now. In 2009, we put intelligent software assistance on the list, really prompted by Siri, which at that time was being developed by a company of the same name and then was later required by Apple. And obviously, intelligent software assistance feels like another name for what we're going to get to later, which are AI agents. And then, five years ago, we put satellite mega-constellations on the list. And then, the number of satellites has, the orbiting earth has nearly tripled. And with two thirds of those, a part of SpaceX's Starlink constellation. Amazing for reaching parts of the world which don't have internet, not so great for astronomers. But I'll be first to tell you, we don't always get it right. So, in the spirit of radical transparency for you guys, Southby, we've got some things wrong over the year. Or maybe we picked the right direction, but the wrong application. So, in 2005, we put airborne networks on the list. This was a new kind of air traffic control, which would do away with ground-based radar systems and control towers and allow planes to transmit and receive information while they're in the air and use software to navigate around each other. Here we are, 20 years later, and we still have air traffic controllers, thank goodness. Then, in 2010, we really thought social TV was going to be a big thing. These are platforms that allowed you to watch a show with your friends from different locations and chat about it all in the same interface. It never really took off. I mean, it still exists. There are still some watch party apps out there, but never really took off in the way that we envisaged it. But I would suggest that maybe the rise of things like Twitter and second screening while you're watching a live sporting event or a season finale or something is sort of along the same lines. In 2015, we went all in on Magic Leap, which you may remember was a company that was developing an augmented reality headset. And the promo videos were amazing. I remember it just been blown away. Oh, my God, this is going to be the future. I've got a lot of buzz. Magic Leap stood exists, but really companies like Snap, Microsoft and Apple have taken that technology much further. Apple was on our list last year for Vision Pro. Tury, I think, is still out. Last year in 2016, a company called Solar City was building one of the largest plants for solar panels in the world in New York. And made all kind of big promises, got loads of government money. We put that giga factory, as it was called, on the list. But the company ended up racking billions in debt and was later required by Tesla, which used the factory to make solar roof panels, which also didn't really pan out. Okay. So we've been over what this list is all about. And some of our hits and misses over the years. So now you're probably thinking, come on, let's just get on with it. Let's get to the list. This is why I'm here. I just like to tease you as long as possible before we actually get to it. All right. This is MIT Technology Reviews 10 breakthrough technologies. All right. Space, starting with. So the night sky here in Austin is absolutely awesome. But when you go on supper at it later tonight, possibly after a couple of beers and a taco, consider the particles inside everything you can see only make up 5% of what's out there in the universe. Dark energy and dark matter make up the rest. But what seems crazy to me is that we don't really know what that is. We still don't know. We just know it's there. So the Vera Rubin Observatory is a massive new telescope in Chile that explores this question and other cool cosmic unknowns. It's been run by the US National Science Foundation. It's been completed now and it's due to take its first images in the middle of this year if everything goes according to plan. The telescope at houses contains the largest digital camera ever built. It's about the size of a small car. So it's named after Vera Rubin, an astronomer who observed that stars on the distant edges of many galaxies were behaving in an unusual way. They were moving much faster than expected. In fact, they were moving so fast that you'd expect them to escape their own galaxies and fling off into space. But they weren't doing that. We didn't know why. Some kind of powerful gravitational force was holding them in place. That was the best evidence to date of the existence of dark matter. So the observatory's first mission is to complete a ten-year study called the Legacy of Space and Time. What a ridiculously cool name for a study. Every night is to take photos of the southern sky, capturing the same sections over and over and over and doing the whole sky of the course of a few nights. Astronomers will use that information to make the most detailed 3D map ever of the Milky Way and also create a time lapse video of the night sky. So in this picture, I think you've got up. You see that's the back of the camera I mentioned, the giant digital camera. It has six filters designed to pick up many different aspects of the electromagnetic spectrum. So doing this 3D map is going to help them discover billions of new stars and galaxies and getting back to the Rubens work. Perhaps by seeing how all these galaxies are arranged and what's known as the cosmic web, we'll be able to have a better idea of how dark matter helped shape this thing and the influence it's having. As you can see, just ridiculously cool engineering. I'm a real sucker for just massive bits of metal in labs. Next, by the way, look at that art. Next we have Generative AI Search. This is probably the one that's most familiar to all of you here. We'll pick this one because obviously all of us search the internet every single day and this represents the biggest change in decades in how we navigate the internet and find information online. Traditional search companies like Google and Microsoft, which makes Bing, of course, are incorporating large language models into their search engines. That means you can type in a query and in Google's case, what's called an AI overview pops up. So you've sure you've all seen this now, I know you've all been using them. It's a large language model summary of a topic or answer to a question and it's generated for you just in the moment and it's not programmed or scripted. It's actually really cool. The idea is conversational in style and really for me it makes a lot more sense than, I mean, when you look at it, it makes almost sense that you hold Google through thing you have to do to try and like, you know, work out how you get your answer out of Google and then decide which of the links to click on to get your answer. If you can just be given to you in conversational style, surely that's much better. Well, obviously there are caveats to this. But it's not just in search engines but also in things like chat GBT and apps and on people's phones. And it could be a step towards useful AI agents as well, which will go out onto the internet and complete tasks on your behalf. Remember, these models don't actually know if that overview is wrong or right. They're just assembling it. They'd suck up the entirety of the internet and then guess what word is should come next. Often write sometimes wrong. If you might remember the rocks on your pizza incident from AI overviews. Oh no, putting glue on your pizza. That's because we think that AI, Google AI overview had sucked up lots of Reddit joke entries about what you should put on pizzas. So, next, small language models. So, you've probably all heard about large language models, right? Of course you have. So, giant things trained on the entirety of the internet using trillions of parameters. These are the values that get calculated during training that the model then uses to produce results. And they do jaw-dropping stuff. They're taking over the world. But they're big, unwieldy, impossible to understand. And let's be honest, an environmental nightmare. Now, though, there's growing interest in something called small language models, which I think you can probably guess what they are. But the idea is that they don't have as much training data. Or as many parameters. And they still do some pretty awesome things. The key thing is they're focused. So, these small language models might be more suited to the specific purpose or task you're trying to get them to do. So, example, if you're a law firm that writes lots of contracts, you don't need a large language model that's been trained on the entirety of every Disney script ever. You probably just need a large model that really knows about contracts. And it's really well versed in that. The other thing about them is that because they're much smaller, they're much more private. They don't have to be sent, you don't have to send queries off to another company or to a big public cloud. You can have them host them on your own private server. And you can train them on your company's own data. And fine-tune it on your data as well. Even though they can't maybe chat about everything in the world like chat bots can, they can really get to the heart of the thing you're trying to get them to do. The more efficient, the less expensive, produce for your missions, which is becoming increasingly important. They can also work offline and soon be small enough to run on your phone. Some of them are doing just as well as big ones on benchmark tests that we train large language models on. So, OpenAI offers GPT-40 and GPT-40 Mini. Google DeepMind has Gemini Ultra and Gemini Nano. And on ThropicsClaude3 comes in three flavors. Outside Opus, Mid-Size Sonnet and Tiny High-Coo. I've asked my colleague, Will Douglas Heaven, our senior AI editor, to tell us more. Over to you, Will. Hi, Will. I'm Will Douglas Heaven, and I'm the senior editor for AI here at MIT Technology Review. Now, if you've been following the giant leaps in AI over the last few years, you may have noticed that bigger typically means better. Step changes in the size of large language models were match by step changes in performance. Look at OpenAI, the company that really first doubled down on this pattern. Its large language model GPT-2 wasn't bad. Of course, it was easier to impress people way back in 2019. But GPT-3, just a year later, was the true breakthrough. The while moment that cemented OpenAI's dominance and laid the foundations of today's boom. A boom that's been sustained across the industry by bigger and bigger models. How big are we talking? GPT-3 was more than a hundred times larger than GPT-2. And GPT-4 is thought to be ten times larger than GPT-3. But what do we mean by bigger? Size is measured by the number of parameters the model has. Think of these as the math values inside the model that get adjusted when it's trained and then determined its behavior. More parameters means more fine green pattern matching, helping the model capture more information from the data it learns from, across billions and billions of documents. The more parameters also means more computation to train and then run these models. The correlation between size and performance became known as the scaling law. But there's a twist. The law has limits. The marginal gains between top end models seem to be trading off. When OpenAI released its latest model in the GPT-Line-9, GPT-4.5 and February, it claimed it was its biggest model yet. But it landed within an all-round name. It's good. Of course, it's good. But good enough to justify the high-watering costs both financial and environmental. Many people are not too convinced. And so the last year has seen an explosion of smaller and smaller models that can do more with less. Large language models have become a tool for almost any job. But we don't need Thor's hammer for every little nail. Regular handlers will do just fine. We're finding that for certain tasks smaller models that are trained on more focused datasets can now perform just as well as large ones. If not better, that's a boom for businesses eager to deploy AI in a handful of specific ways. You don't need the entire internet in your model if you're making the same kind of request again and again. Most big tech firms now boast fund-sized versions of their flagship models for this purpose. The growing number of smaller companies offer smaller models as well. It's also not too hard to downsize a large model. One of the takeaways that got lost in the deep sea kite is that they took the large model that they trained and squeezed many of its capabilities into a handful of smaller ones by training them on its have-le. A trick known as distillation is just happening more and more. Small models are more efficient making them quicker to train and run. That's good news for anyone wanting a more affordable owner. And it could be good news for the climate too because smaller models work with a fraction of computing power acquired by the giant cousins. And so they burn less energy. These small models also travel while they can run rice market without needing to send requests to the cloud which is good for privacy and slow data connections. Even car companies are building small models and they're vehicles as customers come to expect that chap what experience wherever they are and whatever they're doing. Small is the next big thing. Thank you Will. Yes as you may have guessed he's also British. They're not all British I swear. But Will is a bit of a superstar. He's our senior AI reporter and he wrote that piece. What is AI which is a really epic look at what even is AI to begin with. So thank you Will. As he says small is the next big thing or at least that is our educated prediction on the future. So next we have a fun one completely different, completely different angle. Cattle birthing remedies. Look at that art. Isn't that cool? Flouting cows. Anyway, preface this one by telling you cows are evil. No, cows are a nightmare actually. Cows are a nightmare because when the cows burp they do that a lot. They burp on methane. It's a byproduct of their digestion and also very potent greenhouse gas. Methane is eight times as bad as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. So we're looking at techniques that we can find to prevent the cows giving off so much methane in the first place. Cow burps are also one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Lifestyle commissions contribute up to 20% of the world's total climate pollution. Of course this is a lot of effort over the years to get people to eat less meat. One of the things we had on our list a few years ago was plant-based meats and then the cellular agriculture lab grown meat to try and get people to reduce the amount of beef they eat. But honestly it's probably not very realistic. The world is getting richer. The world gets richer so does beef consumption. So our next choice on the list are supplements that actually tackle the burping problem at its core. Oh nice. So these supplements can be mixed into cows food or water. One called bovia is available in 55 countries already and it inhibits an enzyme in the cows gut. That makes methane from hydrogen and carbon dioxide during digestion. Reduces emissions by about 30% in dairy cows. Several other startups are working on different technologies which use a type of red seaweed that they hope will be even more effective. Maybe up even to the 50 to 80% reduction in methane production. So I've asked my colleague James Temple not a Brit. I'll see near climate editor to tell us more. Tell us more James. Thanks Neil. Hello Southby. I'm James Temple. I'm the climate editor at MIT Technology Review. There is still some lingering questions about how effectively supplements can turn out to be in terms of cutting livestock emissions. Whether they can be cost-effectively administered in certain situations like raising cattle or farmers. We've seen them every few weeks or days. And whether or not more of them will ultimately earn the necessary regulatory approvals. But now that cattle burping supplements have begun moving into the market, for me the big question is, are cattle ranchers and dairy farmers really going to widely adopt them? And that is most likely going to come down to whether or not they really pay off on something. The promise among some of the companies is that they'll deliver a secondary benefit. They should make digestion more efficient which means the cattle will produce more meat. Now which means higher sales per farmhouse. The company marketing bovia in the US. The supplement that has been improved in most countries so far highlights that farmers can also earn and sell carbon credits for using the products. So that should perhaps cover the costs or even provide an additional revenue stream. I also wonder if there's going to be an inch of consumers who will pay a little more for low-methane milk, meat or climate-friendly cheese. Which would enable companies to differentiate their products in some ways and be able to charge some of the premium for them. Finally, there are some ways that we can see public policy push-wampers. For instance, last year Denmark announced plans to enact a tax on cattle emissions. But farmers are not super surprisingly on a huge fan of that kind of approach. And my suspicion is when I can see a lot of laws like that pass in countries where cattle farming is a big powerful industry. So at least in the immediate years ahead the real test will be whether or not these pills prove to pay off for the farmers to give them a try. Brilliant, thank you James. I believe James is based in Reno and he's our senior climate editor. And yeah, maybe climate-friendly meat could be on the plate. So confession. The next one on our list is Robo Taxis. And living in the UK I've never actually been in one. In fact, though I shouldn't feel too bad, I say about myself. Most people around the world haven't been in one yet. But still pretty niche, but we think they're coming. Really coming. For years these companies such as Waymo have been out gathering data and testing their services. It's now possible to hail a ride in dozens of cities around the world, fully autonomously with no safety driver. What do you think this is going to become increasingly common as the competition heats up? So many companies are expanding into new areas. Chinese firms including AutoX, We Ride and Pony AI plan to move into Singapore, the Middle East and the US. And in Waymo, as I'm sure many of you know, is just announced a partnership with Uber to provide Robo Taxis here in Austin from this week. Have to try and get in one before I leave. Zooks, which is Amazon project, will launch in Vegas. And of course, Elon Musk has promised the Tesla will begin testing Robo Taxis in California and Texas here this year. Companies are also getting smarter at training these vehicles. I think that's what's interesting. As you remember back in the days of autonomous vehicle research, like 10, 15 years ago, companies had to map every single bit of every single road with various sensors, lasers. And if you took that car away from the road that been trained on and put it in new road, it would be in real trouble. So now, what all of car companies are doing, and particularly as a few new startups, are using Geronative AI to make synthetic training data for scenarios that don't happen that often. And they're going to get up to speed on what to do faster in those cases. Others are trying to develop, going even further, developing general purpose Robo Taxi AI models that can be trained in one city and then transferred over to a new city and go straight off without having to start again learning that city from scratch. And that's the sort of thing that's going to turbo charge this area. I've asked our editor-in-chief Matt Honen to tell us about what to look for next. Matt, over to you. Both from San Francisco. My name is Matt Honen, and I'm the editor-in-chief at MIT Technology Review. In San Francisco these days, Robo Taxis, like this Weymoo on Riding In Right Now, are a common sight. Worked just like a Uber. You summon a car with an app, and your phone, rolls up, you hop in, takes you where you want to go. It's price competitive with Uber, and I've found they often become faster than a human driver. In fact, these cars are now on San Francisco's big tourist attractions. It's kind of weird. And the company announced last week that it's at 200,000 paid trips per week. That's twice as many as there were last year. That's not only put them on the list. Robo Taxis aren't just taking over San Francisco. They are taking over the world. There are autonomous vehicles on the roads in San Francisco, LA, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Austin, right where you are. And they're coming soon to cities like Atlanta and Miami. More to the point, they're in Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore, and Abu Dhabi. In fact, it's a much bigger business in China than it is here in the United States. By Duse Apollo Go, for example, just one of several Robo Taxi operators there, and now it's in a completed more than 9 million passenger rides as of January this year. And as you see, we just successfully dodged that bus. All right, well, I got to go. I still get a little nervous in these things. Have fun there in Austin. All right, thank you, Matt. Imagine if that bus had just clipped in. How good that would have been for the show. No commitment to the bit. All right. All right, I was Robo Taxis. So next on a list, clean a jet fuel. So again, this might be something you're aware of, but there are reasons why we think this is going to take off. I'm going to become big. Take off. I did not intend that pun, but I'll keep it in. The aviation sector is another area, a bit like agriculture, where getting rid of the emissions is really tough. In addition to biofuels, which have been around for a while, there are new ways of creating alternative jet fuels that are now starting to scale up in production. And perhaps more importantly, new policies that are coming to play that will require that they are used. Initially, these fuels will be blended with petroleum to reduce emissions in flights, but eventually we cut off planes that run on 100% sustainable aviation fuels. Generally speaking, these planes can do that without having to be substantially refitted, which is an important part of the, how do you get a technology out into the real world. So there's a company called 12 that's building a plant in Washington state has a reactor that takes in condo oxide, captured from the air, adds water, and then uses electricity and a metal catalyst to split them both. The company then can recombine those elements and form jet fuel. Another company called LanzaJet opened its first commercial scale production facility in Georgia about a year ago to turn ethanol from corn or sugar into jet fuel. And LanzaJet can also use municipal solid waste or industrial waste gas to make its fuel. So this progress is great to see. It's a really cool technology. The reason we put on the list this year is not only because these new production facilities are opening up, but also because the new policy taking effect in Europe that will really start to increase demand. And I think this is one of those aspects where a big block like Europe puts a new policy in place and it will have ripple effects elsewhere because airlines don't have to do two things at once. It's an important part of the puzzle. So starting this year, sustainable aviation fuel has to make up at least 2% of all fuels used in airports in the EU and the UK. This is going to ramp up gradually until it reaches 70% in 2050 in the EU. So the vast majority of jet fuel is going to have to switch over from fossil fuels to these lower-mission alternatives by them. And this is one of those ones, sorry, just go back to it. This is one of those ones that when it was brought to the pitching discussion in our newsroom, I was quite surprised by. I thought it was much more far behind where it actually is and I was really stunned by what the compelling case that I've kind of reported made for this one. Alright, fastening robots. So I love robots. I've been into robots since I've been a tech journalist more than 20 years and I just love going to see robots do funny stuff. But roboticists have often struggled to get robots that actually do much that's useful. Probably the closest any of us have been close to robots either in an industrial arena or with a rumble. I've seen a lot of robot demos in my life as a tech journalist and they always show a robot doing something really specific really really well like flipping a burger or making me a cocktail. And I was like, wow, you video is it. But then if you took that robot and you said to flip something else, I don't know, that's not my thing. I just do burgers. So we're yet to see a robot that can just be adapted easily to different environments to different tasks. That's changing. We're getting closer now because of stuff that's coming out of the generative AI and large language model revolution. New data set, new training techniques that have come from that area. The shift is enabling here is like instead of teaching robots to do by carefully programming and scripting them, it's letting them learn how to do things on their own. For robots, what they need to know to move safely in the world is how to get stuff done. It's like to move safely without bashing into things or swiping people. For that to teach them about the environment, you need, it's not as easy as just like the written text and that you would need for a large language model producing AI overviews. For example, you need spatial data, audio, 3D maps. One of the ways you teach them is to get a human, cover them in centers and get them to do the task a few times and the robot watches and learns from that and how to do it. So robots are combining all these different types of data into new data sets designed just for robots. And then using that special data set to train robot specific AI models that are specific to them and their needs and they can be modeled and changed depending on which new environment you drop them into. This, for a cute little picture, is early prototypes of robotic botlar from a company called Prosper which conform household tasks in cleaning a kitchen or throwing out the garbage and it's got a nice sort of like a jetsony retro vibe to it as well. So with these techniques, the idea is it gets easier to train a robot on just a few examples of one task and then have it pick up that task right away and even transfer it to a completely new task. It also navigates terrain without having studied that particular terrain and this is also very similar to the robot axi idea that it's been really difficult to train it to move around. You know, remember watch the videos of a DARPA challenge from a few years ago where like really cool looking robots like Starwalk of Slight Hill and they're just fall over or like they try to open a door and like collapse. That's kind of stuff is because you had to train it to do every single movement individually. That is may no longer be the case soon. So we don't have robot butlers yet but we might do soon we could say. Okay, next. We only got three more. We're time. Okay, we're okay. Starting with long acting HIV prevention meds. So more than one million people around the world still become infected with HIV every year. You know probably that there are preventative drugs out there, one called prep which can be pills or injections and these work really well. The problem is you have to take them every day or you have to take them ahead of possibly being exposed to the virus which people don't always know they're going to do and also people can forget to take their tablets. The new drug is good much more convenient and accessible way of people to protect themselves against HIV. It's called lenecapavir and I wrote it out phonetically for myself here because I've really struggled to say it. lenecapavir and you get it as an injection once every six months and it's made by a company called Giliad. It targets a structure within the virus that holds the viruses from netting material and either prevents the virus from replicating and entering a human cell or it disables copies of the virus that have already been made and stopped them from spreading further. Last year Giliad announced results from a trial of more than 5,000 women and girls in Uganda and South Africa. It showed the drug was 100% effective in preventing HIV infection. I'd like to ask my colleague Jess Hamsaloo our biotech senior reporter to tell you more and yes you will note she's also British. Jess, over to you. Thanks Neil. I'm Jess. I cover health and biotech at MIT Technology Review. Yes, this was extremely exciting for a few reasons. First of all, the drug only needs to be injected once every six months. That's a huge deal considering that one of the biggest challenges with HIV prevention medicines is making sure that people are member to take them. The most exciting thing though is just how effective it is. In that Uganda and South Africa trial, none of the women and girls who got the lenecapavir injections got HIV, the drug was 100% effective. You don't ever hear 100% effective in medicine so that result was jaw dropping. A big challenge will be making sure that once it's approved, this drug is accessible for those who need it. At the moment, approved forms of lenecapavir in the US can cost over $40,000 per person per year. That's just not going to work in lower middle and come countries. To its credit, Giliad has already signed licensing agreements with six manufacturers who will make generic versions of the drug and sell it in 120 low resource countries that have a high incidence of HIV. Six have pointed out that none of these manufacturers are based in sub-Saharan Africa, where the clinical trials were conducted. So countries with the highest HIV burden might still end up having to import the drug. And the manufacturers aren't allowed to sell the generic drugs in middle income countries, which probably won't be able to afford those US level prices. Still, it's very exciting, but it's not the end of the story. We still need to make sure that when it's approved, this drug is accessible to everyone who needs it. Brilliant. Thanks, Jess. And again, Jess is an after-sensation reporter. I definitely recommend you go and check out her work. Next up, we have green steel. Actually, before I get onto green steel, I just want to say I'm hoping I'll have a bit of time for questions at the ends. So if you can submit them via the Slido app, I'll try and get a couple of in for the time cuts out. So next up, green steel. I want to be honest with you, obviously, making greener ways to make steel or concrete aren't as cool as robots, and gerundative AI search, and robot axes are not going to try and pretend they are. But coming back to that would impact. Impact is what we're interested in, and green steel has the potential to have the gigantic impact on emissions. Here's why. The world produces a lot of steel, about 1.9 billion tonnes a year. We build it, you know, use it to build all sorts of things, but it's incredibly dirty industrial process. For every ton of steel you make, you create an extra two tons of carbon dioxide. Adding up to nearly 10% of such emissions worldwide. The global steel market is expected to grow by about 30% by 2050. Do you imagine that scaling up those emissions? Well, that's going to do. So now there's a company in Sweden called Stegra. It's building a new plant that will produce steel without creating any emissions. It's the first of its kind in the world, and the company hopes to start producing steel there next year. So how it works. A key step in the steel making process is converting iron ore into iron, and this historically is required loads of coal. Stegra instead uses hydrogen gas to pull oxygen out of iron ore to make iron, and then it makes that hydrogen through electrolysis using electricity produced from wind and hydro power to split water. There are other approaches too. There's a compost startup called Boston Metal, which spun out from MIT. It's running an electrical current through the iron ore to break up its bonds and separate out pure iron, and it's also a plans to use renewable energy to do that as well. Last but not least, we have stem cell therapies that work. And those two extra words on the end are pretty important. So we've been covering stem cell research for decades, and it's incredibly cool. The cells are really powerful because just a bit of tweaking in the lab, scientists can use them to then make any other type of tissue in our bodies. It's pretty magical stuff. So we've known about them for quite a while, but scientists also found ways to make them in the lab without needing embryos, which obviously had ethical issues with it. So no longer use that, you can just create stem cells from bits of other bits of human tissue or skin cells, that kind of thing. So really cool science, but all this knowledge has, for the most part, failed to translate into anything useful or practical. Lots of promise, lots of promise. I remember covering them 10 years ago, and we were all excited about what it might mean. And it wasn't really, it took a long time to get to where it is now. But the reason it's on the list this time is that we've got some really solid evidence that now is the time. New treatments for type 1 diabetes and epilepsy based on stem cells are showing real promise. It could help some day help millions of people get off insulin for good or dramatically reduce the number of fits that people have. So for an example, one of our reporters spoke with a patient who was in a trial by a company called Neurona Therapeutics. He was having epileptic seizures every day. In the trial, he received neurons that were specifically made in the lab to fix the electrical signaling in his brain that was causing those seizures. He now has seizures about once a week. So they haven't gone completely, but it's a dramatic change in quality of life. For people with type 1 diabetes, they have to monitor their blood sugar levels daily. Now there have been a few trials by different companies showing that studies can take stem cells from someone, transform them into stem cells and then turn them into the kind of cell that produces insulin in the pancreas. When researchers put those newly transformed cells back into patients, some of those patients start producing insulin on their own for the very first time. And it's really cool, it's really dramatic. It's still quite early, but we're excited by it. Obviously, the treatments could have huge positive benefits for all the patients, but it also marked for us a really important moment in stem cell research that we wanted to mark on the list this year. So that's it. There's the list. 2025, 10 breakthrough technologies from MIT technology review. And I feel like it'd be interesting to look back in five, ten years and see where we were right, where we were wrong, where we got close, but didn't quite catch what the actual treatment was. Perhaps there are some things there that you're familiar with and others that hopefully are new to you for the first time. And of course, if you don't agree with what's on the list, that's totally fine. I'm prepared to fight people to the death, if that's the case. No, sorry, I love to hear dissenting views. Everyone knows that about me. Even if you do agree with our picks, remember, these are our best educated projections about the future based on what we know right now. Things can change. In fact, in our experience, we found they almost certainly will. So in that spirit, I'd like to show you three technologies that were nominated for the list, but didn't quite make the cut. And I'll tell you why we didn't pick them this time around. So first up, this is close. This is where virtual power plants, digital systems, the utilities use to measure power across the grid. And they allow utility companies to collect things like solar cells and wind turbines with grid batteries and EVs. During times of peak electricity usage, software linked to smart meters may one day automatically power someone's home by drawing electricity from a fully charged EV sitting in a neighbor's garage and reducing demand on the grid. The software, the same software, will then also work out how to compensate that EV owner accordingly. So it's happening. It's starting to happen. In the US, there's an estimated 500 virtual power plants already providing up to 60 gigawatts of capacity. That's about as much total capacity as the US grid will add this year. And there are also systems up and running in China, Japan, Croatia and Taiwan. There's also a project in Baltimore in Maryland to use F-150 trucks to power homes managed by virtual power plants. Other stuff happening in China and Taiwan, as I said. But we just didn't have enough examples to feel like this really was now was the time to get on the list. Also, you need a lot more virtual power plants before you really make a big difference to the grid. So got killed it. Next up, AI agents. Now this has been a controversial one. I'll tell you. These are all the rage right now. The idea is that AI agents will schedule your meetings and book your trips and carry out all kinds of tasks for you online for you. Perhaps interacting and coordinating with other people's agents along the way. The grand vision for AI agents is kind of like a human PA. Pub you book your location, but also maybe remember that you prefer swanky hotels. So it will only show you things which are rated four star above on TripAdvisor. And then go ahead and book the one that you like for you. It also suggests flights to work best with a calendar, plan the itinerary for your trip based on the weather forecast. Make a list of things to pack. It might even send your itinerary to your friends who live in the area and suggest you meet up and add meet up times to your calendar. Isn't that lovely? Nothing more personal than some of these agents arranging a meet up when they're in town. One vision for agents is that they are multimodal. It means they can process language, audio and video. And I think they're really cool. It's a really cool idea. I'm really into it. And I think it's where we're headed if we want to find get AI to be really useful and really interact with our lives. But truth is, it's kind of early here. Open AI and Anthropic have both released early versions of AI agents but they're very simple, very basic. They don't do all the things that we hope AI agents will be able to do down the road. And there's also loads of challenges around reliability. So if you're going to let an AI agent go off onto the internet and do stuff for you and book things for you, you're going to have to really trust that it knows exactly what to do. And we're not there yet with trusting AI. Also interoperability challenges. How is it going to interact with your word doc and then also your browser and send you an email. There are lots of technical challenges. And we thought maybe it's just a little bit too early to get on the list. Particularly, he did a discussion which I did enjoy. But in the end we decided not this year. If I come back here again next year, let's see if it's made it. And the third one I wanted to mention that came up in our discussions with air taxis. Electric vertical take off and landing aircraft, F-tolls. It's got a very sort of like, dude, where's my jetpack vibe about this, doesn't it? It's like, that's never going to happen. But they're kind of like electric helicopters or supersized drones. They're not personal vehicles like you might remember from like sci-fi. Instead the idea is a pilot that will take passengers from the suburb downtown or take you from the airport in town. Like a little like a flying taxi. There's some real progress here. Interest from major players in the US and in China and manufacturers doing test flights. As the Chinese companies receive the first license there to mass produce its vehicles and start taking customer orders. And other countries like South Korea and the UE have put in policies in place that allow these things to fly. In the US, a company called Archer received its FAA certification last year to begin commercial operations. But none of these companies have actually started commercial operations yet. So we thought not just yet for us. So there's a 2025 list. You've heard about the things that didn't make it. I have one more thing to show you before we wrap up. I'm not going to need your help on this one. This is gay interaction. Every year we put out the list. We also publish a poll where we ask our audience, which includes you, lovely people. What do you like to see featured as the 11th breakthrough? It's kind of like a people's choice award for emerging technology. So you have four options. You go to the QR code, get your phone out, take that and scan it and vote for your favorite one. It will take you to the landing page of the package. If you scroll to the bottom or click on the number 11, that will get you right on the poll. I'm going to quickly run through and describe them to you. I'm going to try and do it in a neutral way as possible to not influence any potential votes. I do not want to make use of vote rigging. In the poll we have brain computer interfaces. Several companies working on these that are now starting to do really cool stuff with trials. Obviously, Neuralink is the most famous obvious reasons and has placed it in plant in a few volunteers with plans for more. Another company called Synchron is a bit further along, is working on a large clinical trial. Both companies are trying to use the chip in someone's brain to help people navigate the internet, communicate, play games. Some issues around it in that the chip can move over time and the signal can degrade, but it's really cool and it's advanced a lot in the last few years. Methane detecting satellites, it's not just cows that are in nightmare, there are also leaks from oil and gas facilities. A number of projects using satellites to spot the leaks and are making the data public and open source. Companies can either use it to fix their equipment or more likely advocacy groups can then use it to hold them accountable and name and shame. Hyper-realistic deep fakes suddenly become a lot easier to make a virtual version of yourself. The digital avatars look like you, talk like you, adopt your mannerisms. There's a comedy called Synthesia that we've covered and our reporter had an avatar made of herself. And honestly, for the people who know her really well, you could tell it wasn't quite her, but people who didn't really know her, it was basically possible to know it wasn't. And that's kind of amazing, but also a little bit scary. The people using it in e-commerce, in China it's already being used a lot. If you do e-commerce online or you're selling things on the web, you could do your nine hours online and then for the rest of the day you can set up your avatar to take over seamlessly from you and none or never know the wiser. There are also negative potential impacts in terms of using these avatars for non-concentral revenge stuff as well. The other thing about them is also they're suddenly become a lot easier to make. You don't have to go to a big studio and be scanned in a camera like our reporter did. You can now pretty much do it with your laptop and a decent camera. And then finally continuous glucose monitors, not a new technology per se, but they've been suddenly become much more widely available in the last year or so. They are life-changing devices for people with diabetes, the monitor blood sugar 24-7 without a thing brick, and then if you connect them with an insulin pump, you can get insulin delivered automatically whenever it detects that you need it. So do cast your vote and let us know what you're interested in. So that's all I've got for you today. I've got a few minutes for a few questions so if you start thinking and putting them through. Sorry, can I just go back on slide? No. Okay, all right, so I go straight it. Oh, yeah, sorry. Something I wanted to mention to you all. Oh, yeah, this is basically it. This is the slide where we have QR code to subscribe to cover our work. This is, you know, we have the download, so our daily newsletter that covers everything you need to know in technology that day, which is free and fantastic. And I honestly am not just saying that, but we are one of the best tech outlets out there and we are trusted. You trust us to get things right and not hype stuff and give you a look at what's happening in the future. So do have a look at that and subscribe if you can. All right, on to the questions. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Okay, we've got a question. What technology on the list you think will have the biggest impact on the most people? That's an interesting way of deciding like how you work this out because really probably HIV prevention meds will have the biggest impact across the internet, but there's a lot of potential obstacles as Jess mentioned around cost for that. So that one I think is probably the biggest number of people, but probably in terms of day to day lives and how that changes and the generative AI search and how we interact on the internet, I feel like is the most immediate one. And it has, I didn't mention it earlier when I was talking about it, but obviously as well as the potential issues around getting things right or wrong, there are also issues with what it means for publishers like us. We're moving towards an era where the such thing is a zero click. So if someone wants to know about what's our, the 10 breakthrough technologies in my T technology review, they might search for that in Google and get an AI overview that gives them the information they need, whether actually having to come to visit us, which is obviously problematic in terms of us paying for our journalism. Based on the top 10 list from last year, oh sorry there's a question from Dakota, based on the top 10 list from last year, what would you change? Ah, that's a good one. Well, I would say, I would, I wouldn't say if I would change it, there's also another question. Yeah, I wouldn't say I would change it, but Apple Vision Pro was on our list last year and it's incredibly cool technology. Now we really thought, because with Apple's track record it was going to take off and change the way we interact with stuff in the augmented reality world, and it hasn't really done that. It's still really cool, it still works really well, but you don't see people around with them all the time. I think maybe that, maybe it was too early, or maybe a future version of Vision Pro is going to be the one that will make our list. Have you ever had to pull the light in off the list before it publishes? Hmm, I don't think we have. Or what we often do is we end up with two or three things right at the end, which are vying for the 10th spot. So some of those things I mentioned, like virtual power plant and hyper-reversed avatars, we're in the running to be on the list for this 10th slot, and then last minute, right up to the wire, discussions, heated discussions, ended up with where we are. One more question. With a rapid pace of AI and technological innovation, how can we anticipate what's next, the musician ourselves to leverage emerging breakthroughs effectively? Well, I would say that, well, obviously you read MIT Technology Review every single day, but we also help people set up for knowing what's going to come down the line. That's part of what we do. We do a swing called What's Next, across all of our major topic areas. If you read those, that gives you a really good insight into what you need to know down the line. All right, I think that's all the questions we've got. So thank you so much for your time, Southby. Really enjoyed talking to you. Thank you.
